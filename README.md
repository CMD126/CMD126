# Hello, I'm Miguel Sousa (@CMD126) 👋

I'm a self-taught developer with a military background and a mission-driven mindset.  
I come from the Portuguese Army Special Forces (Comandos), where I completed an international mission in the Central African Republic. That experience taught me how to perform under pressure, adapt quickly, and stay focused on results.

Now, I’ve applied that same discipline to the world of technology.

## 🧠 Currently Learning

## 🤝 What I’m Looking For
I'm open to collaborating on impactful projects — especially those involving:
- Open-source tools  
- Distributed system architecture  
- Security, performance, and automation  
- AI integrations and terminal-based assistants
